# Week 2 Activity 2
# Let's write horoscopes.
#We'll introduce some new syntax, but don't worry!

# STEP ONE: Ask the user for their sign, & assign it to this variable.
sign = ...

# Lowercase their result so capitalization doesn't matter
sign = sign.lower()

# STEP TWO: Write a statement to check if their sign is equal to "aquarius"
# And print a result
if ...
    ... # Print result

# STEP THREE: Continue adding if statements for all the signs.

# STEP FOUR: If you want to optimize your code,
# try using "elif" for the statements after your first if.
# Google the syntax for an explanation!
